# git-herd Configuration File
# Place this file in your working directory or ~/.config/git-herd/

# Operation to perform: "fetch", "pull", or "scan"
# fetch: Download changes without merging (safe, recommended)
# pull: Download and merge changes (requires clean working directory)
# scan: Analyze repositories (use with export-scan)
operation: fetch

# Number of concurrent workers to use
# Higher values = faster processing but more resource usage
# Recommended: 5-20 depending on your system and network
workers: 10

# Dry run mode (no changes are applied)
dry-run: false

# Process repositories recursively in subdirectories
# true: Find repos in all subdirectories
# false: Only process repos in immediate subdirectories
recursive: true

# Whether to skip repositories with uncommitted changes
# true: Skip dirty repos (recommended for pull operations)
# false: Attempt operation on all repos
skip-dirty: true

# Enable verbose logging for debugging
# true: Show detailed operation logs
# false: Show only results and errors
verbose: false

# Use plain text output instead of TUI
plain: false

# Display full summary of all repositories
full-summary: false

# Save detailed report to file (empty string disables)
save-report: ""

# File patterns to discard before pull/fetch (empty list disables)
discard-files: []

# Export repository scan to markdown file (requires operation: scan)
export-scan: ""

# Overall timeout for the entire operation
# Format: duration string (e.g., "5m", "30s", "1h30m")
timeout: 10m

# Directories to exclude from repository discovery
# These patterns will be matched against directory paths
exclude:
  - .git           # Git metadata directory
  - node_modules   # Node.js dependencies
  - vendor         # Go/PHP dependencies
  - target         # Java/Maven build directory
  - dist           # Distribution/build output
  - build          # General build directory
  - .vscode        # VS Code settings
  - .idea          # IntelliJ IDEA settings
  - __pycache__    # Python cache
  - .pytest_cache  # Pytest cache
  - .coverage      # Coverage reports
  - .tox           # Tox environments

# Example advanced configuration for different use cases:

# For large monorepos or slow networks:
# workers: 5
# timeout: 30m

# For fast local operations:
# workers: 20
# timeout: 2m

# For CI/CD environments:
# verbose: true
# skip-dirty: false
# timeout: 15m

# For development environments with many repos:
# operation: fetch
# workers: 15
# skip-dirty: true
# recursive: true
